  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout for the ISIC-4799 'Other retail sale not in
  stores, stalls or markets' (door-to-door selling, vending-machine
  retail, direct-sales/party-plan home-demonstration selling)
  operations-coordination actor.

    Phase 0  read-only              -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-logging       -- sale/order-record logging allowed,
                                       every write needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-coordination  -- adds route/vending-machine-fleet
                                       scheduling and supply-order
                                       proposals, still approval-gated.
    Phase 3  supervised auto        -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                       `:log-sales-record`/
                                       `:schedule-route-operation`/
                                       `:coordinate-supply-order` may
                                       auto-commit. `:flag-compliance-
                                       concern` NEVER auto-commits, at
                                       any phase, and a high-cost
                                       `:coordinate-supply-order` still
                                       escalates even at phase 3 (the
                                       governor's own `high-stakes?`
                                       keeps it out of `:commit`).

  `:flag-compliance-concern` is deliberately ABSENT from every phase's
  `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent structural fact, not a
  rollout milestone still to come. This class's consumer-protection
  dimension (door-to-door/party-plan sales are heavily regulated against
  high-pressure tactics in most jurisdictions) means flagging a
  compliance concern always needs a human to actually look at it.
  `nonstoreops.governor`'s own `always-escalate-ops` enforces the same
  invariant independently -- two layers, not one, agree on this."
